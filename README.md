## Windborne Visualizer

An interactive React + Vite dashboard for analyzing and visualizing atmospheric wind and weather data. 
It demonstrates data processing, clustering, and chart-based insights using real or mock telemetry datasets.

---

### Overview

The Windborne Visualizer presents a complete data pipeline from ingestion and transformation to visualization.

It fetches or simulates weather and balloon telemetry data, processes it into clustered datasets, and visualizes patterns such as altitude vs. wind, temperature gradients, and tailwind correlations.

---

### Key Features

- Interactive Visualizations

  - Wind speed vs. altitude scatter plot

  - Temperature gradient and layer comparison

  - Wind rose chart for directional analysis

  - Summary KPIs (average wind, tailwind delta, balloon count)
 

- Data Processing

  - Computes speed, heading, and tailwind metrics

  - Clusters samples into up to 100 groups

  - Enriches with weather data (e.g., from Open-Meteo or mock API)


- Engineering Practices

  - Modular `derive/` layer for transformations

  - Reusable `viz/` components built on Recharts

  - Type-safe data access and clean React hook patterns

  - Lint-compliant and production ready
